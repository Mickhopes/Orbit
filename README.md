# Orbit

Orbit is a UI suite that builds directly into Blizzard's native Edit Mode. No complex setup, no heavy overhaul—just high-end extensions for the default UI.

This project is currently a **WORK IN PROGRESS** If you'd like input into its design moving forward join the discord below.

## The Essentials

*   **Edit Mode Native**
*   **Cooldown Manager**
*   **Enhanced Unit Frames**
*   **Advanced Class Resources**
*   **Cast Bars**
*   **Action Bars**
*   **Pixel-Perfect**
*   **Smart Profiles**

## Modular > Plugin System

Each component is a plugin that can be disabled, so if you're only interested in the Cooldown Manager - you can disable everything else.

In the future, I will probably break the project out into a Core addon and separate plugin packs that compliment it. For development for now, it's easier having it all compiled as a single Addon.


## Why use it?

*   **Clean Modern UI Design**
*   **Semi-Customizable:** The aim is to have qualitative customization without thousands of options and confusing menus.

## More to Come

This Addon is still in alpha testing; it's not feature complete yet and I'm still polishing for a version 1.0 release.
